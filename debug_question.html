            <div class="explanation"><h4>Explanation 1:</h4>(B) "the hitter" is OK, but possibly adds an unnecessary dimension by conveying that there was only one such hitter. Not a strong decision point, as it could be the case that there was only one such hitter.<br>"so much feared" is not a great way to express "so feared." He wasn't "so much feared." He was "so feared."<br>"when coming" does not make sense. A batter is walked once the batter is at bat. "when coming" seems to convey that this person was walked while still coming to bat.<br>(C) "the hitter" is OK, but possibly adds an unnecessary dimension by conveying that there was only one such hitter. Not a strong decision point, as it could be the case that there was only one such hitter.<br>"of such fearsomeness" does not as clearly as "so feared" connect his being walked to how others felt about him.<br>"had come" is not as good as "came" because the sentence is about something that occurred "routinely." "had come" would make more sense in a sentence about what occurred on one occasion when he "had come" to bat. This sentence is about what would happen when "he came to bat." This is an interesting subtle difference.<br>(D) "of such fearsomeness" does not as clearly as "so feared" connect his being walked to how others felt about him.<br>"had come" is not as good as "came" because the sentence is about something that occurred "routinely." "had come" would make more sense in a sentence about what occurred on one occasion when he "had come" to bat. This sentence is about what would happen when "he came to bat." This is an interesting subtle difference.<br>(E) "so much feared" is not a great way to express "so feared." He wasn't "so much feared." He was "so feared."<br>"when coming" does not make sense. A batter is walked once the batter is at bat. "when coming" seems to convey that this person was walked while still coming to bat.<br>The best choice is (A).</div>
<div class="explanation"><h4>Explanation 2:</h4>A is correct<br>B: "when coming" implies that he was walked while he was coming out to bat.. which seems ridiculous. "so much feared" is also wrong (I'm sure someone else can explain why) . Also this option says "the hitter" thereby unnecessarily adding that he was the only such hitter... so wrong on 3 counts<br>C: "even when he had come" implies one specific instance in the past which obviously cannot go with the fact that he was "routinely" walked implying that this happened many times.. Also refers to Charleston as "the hitter" instead of "a hitter"<br>D: Again in this option "when he had come to bat" implies on incident in the past which does not go..<br>E: same as reasons for B minus the "the hitter" reason...<br>A by POE</div>
<div class="explanation"><h4>Explanation 3:</h4>much can be used as adjective, adverb or noun..<br>Is it is used as adverb ---if yes than it is correct<br>But if used as adjective --- than wrong</div>
<div class="explanation"><h4>Explanation 4:</h4>+1 A <br>So much is incorrect usage &amp; coming is incorrect as the action was performed in the past &amp; is not continuing in the present</div>
<div class="explanation"><h4>Explanation 5:</h4>I answered A.<br>Here is the explanation :- <br>Meaning of the original sentence : O.C. was a great hitter ; he was feared by his rivals; he was so feared (by his rivals) that he was routinely walked, even when he came to bat.&gt;&gt; I visualize that the last statement means that the hitter is like a gladiator who walks around the arena before battle. Now until this point i am not sure of the structure , i do not like the passive voice. But i have to see if there is a better answer choice that is grammatically correct and that conveys the right meaning.<br>Option B -&gt; Wrong . A)So much feared is wordy; use of 'the' changes meaning. B)'that even when coming to bat' lacks subject.<br>Option C-&gt; Wrong. A) the hitter of such fearsomeness is not compact compared to 'so feared that' and the use of article 'the' changes the meaing B) Even when he had come to is incorrect use of tense , it changes the meaning of the sentence.<br>Option D-&gt; Wrong.  Same as option C.<br>Option E-&gt; Wrong.  A)So much feared is wordy; B)'that even when coming to bat' lacks subject.<br>Please point out . If you find anything wrong with my analysis.</div>

<div class="explanation"><h4>Explanation 9:</h4>Oscar Charleston was <span style="text-decoration: underline">a hitter so feared that even when he came</span> to bat with the bases loaded he was routinely walked.<br><span style="color: #2e3192">The sentence tests correct use of idiom So X that Y. Therefore, whatever tense is used after <span style="text-decoration: underline">So</span> has to be used after <span style="text-decoration: underline">that</span> as well. The non-underlined part clearly indicates that all actions happened in past.<br>Process of POE as per my understanding:<br></span><br>(A) a hitter so feared that even when he came <span style="color: #2e3192">(correct use of idiom +1, <span style="text-decoration: underline">feared and came</span> are both verbs, parallelism+1, best choice)</span> <br>(B) the hitter so much feared that even when coming <span style="color: #2e3192">(incorrect idiom, it is not So much X that Y.

<div class="explanation"><h4>Explanation 10:</h4>Is 'so much feared' the wrong idiom?</div>

<div class="explanation"><h4>Explanation 12:</h4>" he came" gives a sense that we are talking about one particular instance. Am I right?</div>
<div class="explanation"><h4>Explanation 13:</h4>It could be read in that way, but it can also be read as meaning all instances in which he came.</div>
<div class="explanation"><h4>Explanation 14:</h4>Hello <a href="https://gmatclub.com:443/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;un=thakurarun85" class="postlink"><span style="font-weight: bold">thakurarun85</span></a>,<br>We hope this finds you well. <br>To answer your question, as MartyTargetTestPrep has written, "even when he came" can refer to both a single instance and describe a habitual or recurring action. In this context, the latter interpretation makes more sense.<br>We hope this helps.<br>All the best!<br><a href="http://www.expertsglobal.com/?source=GC_mention" class="th23autolinks" title="Look up details">Experts' Global</a> Team</div>
